# Text-to-Speech Generation with LLM using Hugging Face

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Text-to-Speech (TTS) generation** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and the **Hugging Face Transformers library**. It takes text input and converts it into natural-sounding speech. The aim is to explore how modern deep learning models can be fine-tuned and deployed for high-quality voice synthesis.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Text Input** – The user provides text data (e.g., a sentence or paragraph).
2. **Preprocessing** – The text is tokenized and prepared for model inference.
3. **Model Inference** – A pre-trained or fine-tuned **Text-to-Speech model** from Hugging Face generates the corresponding audio waveform.
4. **Audio Output** – The generated waveform is processed and saved/played as a speech audio file (e.g., `.wav` or `.mp3`).
5. **Optional Fine-tuning** – You can fine-tune the model on custom voice datasets for personalized TTS.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Hugging Face Transformers**
- **Datasets & Tokenizers**
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow (backend)**
- **IPython/Jupyter Notebook**

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. Install dependencies (`transformers`, `datasets`, `torch`).
2. Load pre-trained TTS model (e.g., SpeechT5, FastSpeech2).
3. Provide input text.
4. Generate and save the audio output.
5. Optionally fine-tune the model on a custom dataset.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Converts text to **human-like speech**.
- Can support **multiple voices and languages** (depending on the model).
- Customizable for **voice cloning** and **fine-tuning**.
- Works seamlessly with Hugging Face model hub.

## 📝 Example Usage
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a text-to-speech pipeline
tts = pipeline("text-to-speech", model="microsoft/speecht5_tts")

# Input text
text = "Hello, welcome to Text-to-Speech generation using Hugging Face!"

# Generate speech
speech = tts(text)
with open("output.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(speech["audio"])
